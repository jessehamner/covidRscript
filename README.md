# covidRscript
R script and functions to import and make simple state-level and metro/MSA-level plots of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

The file produces a large amount of output files, including plots for each US state, any of the countries contained in the ECDC data set, and any US Metro areas specified in the code. <p>

The code also produces maps, by county, of US metro areas, if desired.<p>

As things are entirely automated, some of the defaults may not be suitable for every chart or map. However, these defaults are slowly improving.

The plots also include cumulative case counts, not just rates of new cases.<p>
